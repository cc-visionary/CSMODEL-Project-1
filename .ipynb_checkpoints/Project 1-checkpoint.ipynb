    "Pricing is one of the most important factors people look at before buying food. This is much more important in areas where the average amount of money buyers have to budget for food is lower than more developed cities/areas. With this research question, we want to see which areas in the rural and urban areas have higher/lower prices in every type of food in the records available. To do this, we need to condense every city that is considered as a rural or an urban city and combine their means to represent the urban or rural side.\n",
    "\n",

    "Despite the availability of food almost everywhere, pricing is not the only factor consumers look at when buying commodities. For the case of rice, there exists multiple types of rice: black rice, red rice, white rice, brown rice, etc. and their preferences may vary. We formulated this research question to see which commodity differed in pricing based on their characteristics. \n",
